I will be assigning a number of tutorials from the [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) website, which you can access for free using your RIT login. 

We will be using Github for me to distribute course materials, and for you to manage your project files. You will need to sign up for a [Github Student Developer](https://education.github.com/pack) pack, which we'll discuss during week 1. 

## Important RIT Deadlines

## Course Description 
This course provides an overview of media in historical, current and future contexts. Incorporating lectures and discussion with hands on work involving written and interactive media assets, students examine the role of written and visual media from theoretical as well as practical perspectives. The course also provides an introduction to interactive media development techniques, including digital media components and delivery environments. Students will be required to write formal analysis and critique papers along with digital modes of writing including collaborative editing and effective presentation design. 

## Assignments
These are brief descriptions of each of the assignments. For each assignment you will receive a more detailed assignment sheet with specific requirements. All assignments must be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date. 

### Project 1: Personal Page for Class (10% of final grade, due 3 Feb 2017)
Personal page project details.

### Project 2: Personal Portfolio Using Frameworks (20% of final grade, due 19 March 2017)

### Project 3: Individual JS-focused Project TBD (20% of final grade, due 15 April 2017)

### Project 4: Group Project (20% of final grade, due finals week)

## In-Class Exercises (20% of final grade)
Every Thursday there will be an in-class exercise, which will be due by the end of the class time. I will also occasionally assign homework in addition to th=e exercise. Exercises and homework will be always be uploaded to that week's folder in this repository, with information on their required submission date and time. They will also be announced in the class Slack. 

## Class Participation (10% of final grade)
You are expected to attend class regularly, and to participate in the class Slack. Both count towards your participation grade. 

## Final Practical Exam (pass/fail -- not included in final grade)
There will be a final practical exam in the class, which will require you to demonstrate proficiency with the technologies we've covered during the semester. It is a pass/fail practical; if you receive at least 7/10 points, you pass the exam. If you fail the exam, you will have an opportunity to retake it during finals week, although you will need to earn at least 8/10 points to pass the second time. If you do not pass either exam, you will receive a failing grade in the class. If you do pass the exam, your exam grade will not impact your final grade in the class.

## Additional Policies
### Communication
Any updates to assignments and any emails that I need to send to individual students will be done through MyCourses. This means you should regularly check your email and the Slack for this course. I check both email and Slack frequently, and will try to always respond within 24 hours (the exception to this is when I’m traveling, for which I’ll give you advance notice). You will get a faster response using Slack, with the bonus that other people in the class can help answer questions, as well. Please send mail to me using your RIT account, and include the course number (110) in your subject line—that will significantly improve my response time!
### Late Policy
If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, please contact me before the due date. Late assignments that have not been cleared with me before the due date may not be accepted, or will include a grade penalty. 
### Missed Classes
If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to check with classmates for notes. I will not recap classes for you. Because your lowest quiz grades are automatically dropped, I will not give make-up quizzes if you miss one. 
### Office Hours
I will have a minimum of four office hours per week. This is an excellent time to come in with questions on the course material, homework, or in class work. I am always happy to help you understand the course material or assignments—or just to chat about whatever topic you’d like. Take advantage of this time, since few students bother to talk with their professors outside of class. If for some reason I’m called away during office hours, there will be a note on the door. 
### Mobile Phones 
Please turn off sounds on your phone, so that you don’t disturb the people around you with notification noises. If you must take a call, please leave the room to do so. 
### Notices of Accommodation
If you have a “Notice of Accommodation”, I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met. 
### Social Networks
I don’t initiate friend requests on Facebook, because I don’t want you to feel obligated to accept. However, I do generally accept friend requests from students. I have a private Twitter account that I seldom use, and don’t accept follower requests on it. I maintain a LinkedIn account, and am happy to connect with students there in order to help them find job-related connections. Links to my various social media accounts can be found on my website (lawley.rit.edu). 
### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only by prior arrangement with me. Note that I only give incompletes in the event of: 1) military deployment or 2) documented and verifiable family or personal illness/emergency. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework does not fall into either of those two categories. Please come see me ASAP if you’re having difficulty so we can find a solution together. 
### Academic Dishonesty
My policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an “F” as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

Please review RIT’s policy on academic dishonesty:
