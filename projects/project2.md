# Project 2: Personal Portfolio

## Description
You will create a personal portfolio site to showcase your work to potential employers and/or customers. The site must include examples of your work, contact information, and your resume. The examples should include at least three different things you've created; those could be projects or exercises from this or other classes, or work you've done on your own. 

## Page and Content Requirements
- Landing page named index.html, including your name and an image (could be a photo or an avatar)
- Gallery page with brief information about each of your work examples (examples can be projects or exercises from this class or other classes, or work you've done on your own)
- Individual pages with more detail for each of your examples
    - each example needs a title, an image (could be a screenshot or photo), and a one-paragraph description that highlights the tools you used and the skills that it illustrates
    - if the example is from a group project, be sure to clearly indicate what your role was on the project
- Contact information page
- Resume (HTML, not PDF) that also has a printer-friendly stylesheet
- Notes page with information about how you made the site, including the following content: 
  - Source information for any images or code that you didn't create yourself (including CSS frameworks, typefaces, and any code libraries)
  - If you used a CSS framework, explain how you modified it so that your portfolio doesn't look exactly like every other site that uses that framework. 
  - What you did to go beyond the base expectations for the project--what did you do that was particularly challenging? This could involve art/design, content, or code. 
  - Must be called notes.html and placed in the portfolio directory, but linking to it from the portfolio navitation is not required (see the Submission & Due Dates section below)

## Design Requirements
- Responsive design with a minimum of two layouts--one optimized for desktop, one for phones
- If a CSS framework is used, colors and typefaces must be modified so that the site is not a "cookie cutter" replica of the framework's templates
- Principles of visual design (taught in prerequisite classes) employed: clear visual hierarchy, good use of white space, effective alignment of content, thoughtful choices of colors and visual elements
- Effective typography employed; typeface(s) chosen should be clear and legible as well as appropriate to the content being presented


## Technology Requirements
- Semantic, valid HTML
- Well-structured, valid CSS
- Passes WAVE accessibility evaluation without significant errors 
- Semantic HTML
- Drop-down menu for navigation available on all pages 
- Images and other media are properly optimized for screen display
