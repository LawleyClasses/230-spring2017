# Project 2: Personal Portfolio

## Requirements
You will create a personal portfolio site to showcase your work to potential employers and/or customers. The site must include a minimum of three separate content sections beyond your main page: examples of your work, contact information, and your resume. 

You must use CSS for all presentation aspects of the site, and semantic HTML elements in your pages where appropriate. Your site must pass HTML and CSS validation, and should have no accessibility errors. It also must use responsive design. 

Using a CSS framework such as Bootcamp or Foundation is acceptable. 

## Due Date
The completed site is due at 11:59pm on Saturday, March 18th. The page should appear properly at the URL specified above by that time. You do not need to send me email or post anything to myCourses.

## Grading
I will post a rubric here before the end of February. 

## Privacy Issues
Occasionally there are reasons that a student doesn't want their name and image visible on the open web. If this is the case for you, please let me know and I'll help you set up password protection that limits access to the RIT community.
