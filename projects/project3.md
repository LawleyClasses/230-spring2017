# Project 3: Create an "IGM Student Survival Guide" Website 

## Description
Working as part of a group, you'll design and implement a website with tips and tricks for IGM students. You'll have deliverables for each of the stages we discussed in week 3: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface.  

## Deliverables

### Strategy and Scope (Submit to myCourses by 8am Sat 3/25)
Your group should write and submit a document in which you describe the specific problem or need you'll be addressing (what should IGM students know that they don't? what would be useful to have in a single place for them to check?), as well as the type of content that you intend to include to address that problem.

### Structure (Bring to class Thursday 3/30; submit to myCourses by 11:59pm)
Create an inventory list of content that you'll include on your site--what's already out there than you can use? What will you need to create yourselves? Generate an information architecture (*not interaction flow*) diagram showing how that content on your site will be grouped and organized. We'll do a brief critique in class before you turn this in at the end of the day. 

### Skeleton (Bring to class Thursday 4/6; submit to myCourses dropbox by 11:59pm)
Create wireframes for each of your major page types (e.g. main/landing page, main category page, individual content page, about page), showing the basic grid and page layout you plan to use. We'll do a brief critique in class, and your group can start on design mockups and code once that's done.

### Surface (Bring to class Thursday 4/13; submit to myCourses dropbox by 11:59pm)
Create mockups in Photoshop or another graphics program showing your intended design for the site. There should be one mockup for each wireframe you created. Once again, we'll do a brief critique in class before you turn them in to myCourses. 

### Final Site (Posted on Github and on people.rit.edu by 8am Wednesday, 4/19)
All files for the site must be posted to your shared GitHub repository. Only one group member has to post the site to their people.rit.edu account, in a guide directory inside of the igme230 directory; everyone else in the group should link to the final site on that person's account. (You can each post your own copy of the site if you'd like, to use as a portfolio piece.) 

## Page and Content Requirements
- Landing page named index.html
- Global navigation bar
- At least three categories of information, with at least three content pages in each
- About page containing the following:
  - Information about your team members (names and photos)
  - Contact form using mailto: action (you can create a throwaway email account for this if you want)
  - Source information for any images, content, or code that you didn't create yourself (including CSS frameworks, typefaces, and any code libraries)
  - If you used a CSS framework, explain if/how you modified its default appearance settings 
  - What you did to go beyond the base expectations for the project--what did you do that was particularly challenging? This could involve art/design, content, or code. 

## Design Requirements
- Responsive design with a minimum of two layouts--one optimized for desktop, one for mobile
- If a CSS framework is used, colors and typefaces must be modified so that the site is not a "cookie cutter" replica of the framework's templates
- Principles of visual design (taught in prerequisite classes) employed: clear visual hierarchy, good use of white space, effective alignment of content, thoughtful choices of colors and visual elements
- Effective typography employed; typeface(s) chosen should be clear and legible as well as appropriate to the content being presented

## Technology Requirements
- Semantic, valid HTML
- Well-structured, valid CSS
- Passes WAVE accessibility evaluation without significant errors 
- Semantic HTML
- Navigation menu available on all pages; can be pure CSS or CSS+JS 
- Images and other media are properly optimized for screen display
- Contact form uses Javascript to validate input; no blank fields, and valid format for sender's email address

## Grading
Component | Percentage of Project Grade |
--------- | --------------------------- |
Strategy & Scope Document | 5% |
Structure Document & Diagram | 15% |
Skeleton Wireframes | 15% |
Surface | 15% |
Final Site | 50% |

Each of the first four deliverables will be graded as Excellent (100%), Good (85%), Poor (70%), or Missing (0%). 

The final site will be graded using the same basic rubric as for the personal porfolio project. Once again, to get the last four "above and beyond" points you'll need to exceed my expectations on least one aspect of your site--use of code, quality of design, depth of content, etc. 

Requirement | Possible Points (20) |
----------- | --------------- |
All required content present | 3 |
Written content quality and organization | 3 |
Responsive Design | 2 |
Visual Design | 2 |
Typography | 1 |
Sematic, valid HTML | 1 |
Well-structured, valid CSS | 1 |
No major accessibility errors | 1|
Drop-down navigation menu | 1 |
Properly optimized media | 1 |
"Above and Beyond" | 4 |
