# IGME-230 Web Design &amp; Implementation, Spring 2017: Prereqs

I expect students in this class to have a basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and publishing to RIT's web hosting environment (people.rit.edu). For GDD and New Media Interactive students, that material was covered in IGME-110. For New Media Design students, my understanding is that you have also taken a class that covers basic web technologies.

If you need to brush up on your HTML and CSS skills, I recommend using the CodeAcademy tutorials that we currently use in IGME-110: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web, lessons 1-5.

I've also uploaded [the exercise from IGME-110 that involves creating HTML files with relative links to images and other pages, and publishing those to the people.rit.edu<http://people.rit.edu> server](110-Fall-2016-Week6-Web-Publishing-Exercise.pdf). I'd suggest reviewing that and making sure that you're familiar with the concepts.

If you have questions between now and the start of class, feel free to send me an email!
