# Week 1 Tuesday Exercise (24 Jan 2017)

## Overview & Goals

We're going to use some class time today to get you set up with the communication tools we'll be using this semester. I'll only be using myCourses for grades--all content will be distributed via this Github repository, and while I'll respond to emails, you'll get faster responses (and help from your peers) if you use the Slack chat I've set up for the class. 

## Github

If you're reading this, you've figured out how to get to our class content on Github. Congratulations! 

Because these materials are in a public repository ("repo"), you don't need a Github account to access them. However, later in the semester you'll be learning how to use Git and Github to keep track of files in your own projects, so you'll need an account for that. 

Github accounts are free, but with a free account you can only have public repos, which means everybody can see all of your files. Since you'll be uploading files related to assignments, private repos make more sense. Happily, Github offers a free "Student Development Pack" that gives you unlimited private repos. Because you need to verify your student status with Github in order to get this perk, I'm going to have you apply for that today. That way we can be sure you'll have a working account by the time you need to start putting your own files online (around week 5). 

Start by going to the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) website. You can see a list there of all the perks you get--the most important one, and the only one you'll need for the class--is the unlimited private repos. 

Click on the link to get the pack, and fill out the form with your RIT email address and your expected graduation date. 

## Slack

I've set up a Slack chat for our class at [http://lawleywebdev.slack.com/](http://lawleywebdev.slack.com/). Right now, it's set up so anyone with an @rit.edu address can create an account, just to make things easier. I'll disable that at the end of the week, so if you add the class late you'll need to request access. (Every Slack uses its own login, so if you use Slack with another group, your account/login there won't work for this one.)

When you choose a user name, please make it something that my TA and I will be able to recognize easily in the chats. Your first name and last initial are ideal, although I'll accept your RIT ID as a username, as well. 

After you've successfully logged into Slack, post a brief message in the #introductions channel so I know you're there. 

## Visual Studio Code

The text editor we'll be using in class for HTML, CSS, and Javascript is Visual Studio Code. It's free and cross-platform, and supports all of the technologies we'll be using the class. To get the most out of it, we're going to add some extensions. 

After launching Visual Studio Code, choose Extensions from the View menu. In the search box, find each of the following extensions and click the button to install them:

- HTML CSS Support
- HTML Snippets
- HTMLHint
- htmltagwrap
- JS-CSS-HTML Formatter
- jshint
- Replace Smart Characters
- stylelint
- View in Browser

We'll be talking in class about VS Code's built-in HTML tools (like Emmet), as well as the additional functionality that these extensions provide.
