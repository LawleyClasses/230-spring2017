# Week 4 Tuesday In-Class Exercise (14 Feb 2017)

## Overview & Goals
Your second project is going to be a personal portfolio site, in which you showcase work you've done in classes and on your own. Today we're going to work through the first design steps for a website, as discussed in last Tuesday's class, and create an initial design document for your site. 

## Strategy: User Needs & Site Objectives
Start by clearly defining who you anticipate will be using your site. Co-op employers? Full-time employers? Freelance job customers? What should your site accomplish? In a new Word or Google Docs document, write a paragraph or two answering these questions. 

## Scope: Functional & Content Requirements
What functionality will your users expect? Should they be able to directly contact you? View a gallery of your work? Play a game you've created? Write this up, in as much detail as you can, and add it to the document. 

What content needs to be included to meet the needs listed in the strategy step? Make a list of all the content you expect to include in the site (including a list of individual pieces of work you've done that could or should be included), and add that to the document. 

## Structure: Information Architecture
It's unlikely this site will involve many branching interactions, so we're going to skip the interaction design flowcharts for this document. You should, however, create a flowchart showing what pages you expect to have on the site (the information architecture) using any of the tools discussed in last week's lecture (all of which are linked from [the schedule](../../Schedule.md#week3). Add the flowchart to your document. 

## Skeleton: Wireframe
If you complete all of the above items, start work on wireframes for the layout and organization of your pages. What will the home page contain, and how will it be laid out? What about the contact page? Individual content pages? (Links to a number of wireframing tools can also be found in [the schedule](../../Schedule.md#week3). Most of those tools will allow you to export an image of the wireframe (or you can take a screenshot, or take a picture if it's hand-drawn). Add this to your document. 

## Uploading and Due Date
At the end of class, upload the document (which should at a minimum have the strategy, scope, and structure sections complete) to the Dropbox in myCourses. (If you created it in Google Docs, use File-->Download As... to save it as a Word .docx file.)
