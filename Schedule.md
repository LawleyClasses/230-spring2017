## Week 3: Web Design & Accessibility
When we talk about "web design," we're actually talking about a much wider range of concepts than graphic design--we're also talking about interaction design, usability, and accessibility. This week we'll talk about the range of design issues related to the web. (Your first project is due at the end of this week.)

## Week 4: Information Architecture
Creating a good website means making sure that you've effectively organized and structured your content, a process known as information architecture. We'll talk about IA this week, and discuss issues related to organizing content on the web. 

## Week 5: CSS In-Depth
Curent versions of CSS allow us to do far more than simply changing the basic appearance and positioning of items on a page. This week we'll be looking at more advanced CSS techniques, including CSS animations, transitions, and media types.
