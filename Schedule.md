## <a name="week1"></a>Week 1 (Jan 24/26): Overview: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools

 - In this exercise, you'll sign up for the (free) Github Student Developer Pack,  set up an account on the class Slack, and configure Visual Studio Code for use in class. Instructions are in the [tuesdayExercise](weekly_materials/week1/tuesdayExercise.md) file in the [week1 folder](weekly_materials/week1/).

## <a name="week2"></a>Week 2 (Jan 31/Feb 2): HTML & CSS, beyond the basics
A deeper dive into aspects of HTML and CSS that aren't covered in the prereq classes: validation, semantic markup, CSS positioning, complex CSS selector types, and more.

- **Tuesday Readings**
 - Review the content in [Lynda.com HTML Essential Training, Lessons 1-6](https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html?org=rit.edu). Some of it will be familiar (like basic HTML formatting). Other parts will be new (like structuring content with semantic tags, linking to regions inside a page, and creating complex lists).

## <a name="week3"></a>Week 3 (Feb 7/9): Web Design & Accessibility
When we talk about "web design," we're actually talking about a much wider range of concepts than graphic design--we're also talking about interaction design, usability, and accessibility. This week we'll talk about the range of design issues related to the web. (Your first project is due at the end of this week.)

## <a name="week4"></a>Week 4 (Feb 14/16): Information Architecture
Creating a good website means making sure that you've effectively organized and structured your content, a process known as information architecture. We'll talk about IA this week, and discuss issues related to organizing content on the web. 

## <a name="week5"></a>Week 5 (Feb 21/23): CSS In-Depth
Curent versions of CSS allow us to do far more than simply changing the basic appearance and positioning of items on a page. This week we'll be looking at more advanced CSS techniques, including CSS animations, transitions, and media types.
