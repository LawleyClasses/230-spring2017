## <a name="week1"></a>Week 1 (Jan 24/26): Overview: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools
I will review the syllabus, goals, and requirements for class. We will discuss the tools and technologies we'll be using for communication, collaboration, and content creation.

- **Tuesday Exercise**
 - In this exercise, you'll sign up for the (free) Github Student Developer Pack,  set up an account on the class Slack, and configure Visual Studio Code for use in class. Instructions are in the [tuesdayExercise](weekly_materials/week1/tuesdayExercise.md) file in the [week1 folder](weekly_materials/week1/).

- **Thursday Exercise**
 - We will review the functionality of VS Code in class, working together in class to take a text file and mark it up as valid HTML. We will also add a configuration file to your banjo.rit.edu account to change its default behavior with web pages. Detailed instructions are in the [thursdayExercise](./weekly_materials/week1/thursdayExercise.md) file.

## <a name="week2"></a>Week 2 (Jan 31/Feb 2): HTML & CSS, beyond the basics
A deeper dive into aspects of HTML and CSS that aren't covered in the prereq classes: validation, semantic markup, CSS positioning, complex CSS selector types, and more.

- **Tuesday Readings**
 - Review the content in [Lynda.com HTML Essential Training, Lessons 1-6](https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html?org=rit.edu). Some of it will be familiar (like basic HTML formatting). Other parts will be new (like structuring content with semantic tags, linking to regions inside a page, and creating complex lists).

## <a name="week3"></a>Week 3 (Feb 7/9): Web Design & Accessibility
When we talk about "web design," we're actually talking about a much wider range of concepts than graphic design--we're also talking about interaction design, usability, and accessibility. This week we'll talk about the range of design issues related to the web. (Your first project is due at the end of this week.)

## <a name="week4"></a>Week 4 (Feb 14/16): Information Architecture
Creating a good website means making sure that you've effectively organized and structured your content, a process known as information architecture. We'll talk about IA this week, and discuss issues related to organizing content on the web. 

## <a name="week5"></a>Week 5 (Feb 21/23): CSS In-Depth
Curent versions of CSS allow us to do far more than simply changing the basic appearance and positioning of items on a page. This week we'll be looking at more advanced CSS techniques, including CSS animations, transitions, and media types. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
 - [Lynda.com CSS:Animation](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Animation/439683-2.html?org=rit.edu)
 
- **Thursday Readings**
 - [Lynda.com CSS Fundamentals, Media Types & Queries](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Media-types-media-queries/417645/484795-4.html?org=rit.edu)
 - [Lynda.com CSS Fundamentals, CSS Resets](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Media-types-media-queries/417645/484795-4.html?org=rit.edu)

## <a name="week6"></a>Week 6 (Feb 28/Mar 2): Online Portfolios & Web Workflow 
Your second project is a portfolio site about yourself and your work. This week we'll look at a variety of approaches to online portfolios, and talk about content, organization, and design. We'll also begin to talk about workflow for websites, particularly version control and collaborative work, and you'll be introduced to Git and Github for tracking and maintaining your HTML and CSS files. 

## <a name="week7"></a>Week 7 (Mar 7/9): Responsive Design & CSS Frameworks
Responsive design involves creating websites that adapt well to a variety of devices and screen sizes, from large computer monitors to small smartphones. Many responsive websites are built using a pre-existing framework of CSS and Javscript that enable the developer to focus on content and design rather than the underlying code necessary for effective responsive functionality. We'll be looking at one of the most widely used frameworks, Bootstrap, this week. 


## SPRING BREAK
Your second project is due at the end of spring break. 

## <a name="week8"></a>Week 8 (Mar 21/23): Javascript Intro: Syntax, DOM, and Debuggers
We'll begin looking at Javascript this week, and its importance in building interactivity into websites. This week will be the basics--syntax, the Document Object Model, and basic debugging using both VS Code and Chrome's developer tools. 

## <a name="week9"></a>Week 9 (Mar 28/30): Javacript Cont'd: Events/Listeners, CSS
This week is a continuation of basic Javascript programming, with a focus on HTML events and event listenters, as well as the interaction between Javascript and CSS.

## <a name="week10"></a>Week 10 (Apr 4/6): JQuery
A great deal of the Javascript on the web uses a freely-available library of code called JQuery (which, in fact, was originally written by an RIT student!). We'll be looking at JQuery and how to use it this week. 

## <a name="week11"></a>Week 11 (Apr 11/13): Client-Side Data Access & Site Security
Most modern websites don't use completely static data--they dynamically generate content from databases or other inputs. This week we'll look at data access on the client (browser) side, and also will talk about the security implications of client-side data access.

Your third project is due at the end of this week.

## <a name="week12"></a>Week 12 (Apr 18/20): Web Server Basics & .htaccess Files 
Understanding the basics of how a web server works can make your work as a designer and/or developer much easier. We'll look at basic web server operation, as well as the use of .htaccess files to modify how the server works with your pages. 

## <a name="week13"></a>Week 13 (Apr 25/27): LAMP Concepts & WordPress Install
The majority of web servers on the Internet use Apache software running on a Linux operating system. Many also use mySQL databases, and the PHP server-side scripting language. The combination of these four technologies is referred to as "LAMP." This week we'll install a copy of WordPress onto a LAMP server, and talk about dynamic database-driven websites. 

## <a name="week14"></a>Week 14 (Apr 2/4): PHP & MySQL Basics
Under the hood, WordPress uses both PHP and MySQL. We'll talk about both technologies this week, and look at how the WordPress database is organized. 

## <a name="week15"></a>Week 15 (Apr 9/11): WordPress Themes & Practical Exam
Once you understand CSS, PHP, and MySQL, it becomes much easier to modify WordPress themes and even create your own. On Tuesday, we'll look at what goes into a WordPress theme. And on Thursday, you'll take the final practical exam for the class. 

## <a name="finals"></a>Finals Week: Practical Exam Makeup
In addition to the makeup practical exam, your group project will be due this week.
